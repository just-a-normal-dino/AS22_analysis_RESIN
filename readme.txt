This folder contains the codes used to generate the material for the paper "Response Item Network (ResIN): A network-based approach to explore attitude systems"

Here's a quick explanation of what every file is

- Graded... 

- "graded_model_from_R.ipynb" shows how we compare the results data curves (obtained from the R code) with the results from Resin [this is about the experimental data]
- "graded_model_full.ipynb" shows the comparison of the results from Resin with the equivalent position for the curves in simulated data
- "new_IRT_testing_short.ipynb" tests how correlation changes as function of the overlap between two curves
- "IRT_test.R" is the R code which extracts the parameters of the graded model from the raw experimental data
- "df_experiment.csv" is the raw experimental data 
- "Network.gexf" is the equivalent Resin network
- "coefficients.txt" is the file with the coefficients extracted from the Graded model
